## 📋 Project Overview

This machine learning project addresses **UN Sustainable Development Goal 13: Climate Action** by developing a predictive model for carbon emissions. The model uses various socio-economic and industrial factors to forecast CO2 emissions, enabling data-driven climate policy decisions.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. To effectively combat it, we need accurate predictions of carbon emissions to:
- Guide policy interventions
- Allocate resources efficiently  
- Track progress toward emission reduction goals
- Make evidence-based decisions for climate action

### 🔬 Machine Learning Approach

**Supervised Learning - Regression**
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Type**: Predictive modeling
- **Goal**: Forecast carbon emissions based on input features
- **Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, R² score

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- **Feature Engineering**: Automated feature selection and scaling
- **Model Training**: Random Forest with hyperparameter optimization
- **Performance Evaluation**: Multiple metrics and visualizations
- **Climate Insights**: Actionable recommendations for emission reduction
- **Prediction Interface**: Easy-to-use prediction function

## 📊 Dataset Features

The model uses the following key features to predict carbon emissions:

| Feature | Description | Impact on Emissions |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| GDP per Capita | Economic development indicator | ⬆️ Higher GDP often correlates with higher emissions |
| Population | Total population in millions | ⬆️ More people generally means more emissions |
| Industrial Production | Manufacturing and industry index | ⬆️ Higher industrial activity increases emissions |
| Renewable Energy % | Percentage of renewable energy use | ⬇️ More renewables reduce emissions |
| Forest Area % | Forest coverage percentage | ⬇️ More forests absorb CO2 |
| Energy Intensity | Energy use per unit of GDP | ⬆️ Higher intensity means more emissions |
| Coal Consumption % | Percentage of coal in energy mix | ⬆️ Coal is the most carbon-intensive fuel |
